The application is composed of a creation of an account creation screen, a log-in page, a soft skills selection page, a hobby selection page and a matching between different companies page.

As requested by the client, the application has two different sides:

- **Candidate**: Candidates create anonymized profiles, select soft skills and hobbies, and receive job matches. They can communicate with companies and schedule interviews within the app via email.
- **Company**: Companies create profiles, specify desired soft skills, and post job openings. They can browse candidate matches, communicate with candidates, and schedule interviews within the app via email.

## 3. Functionalities

### 3.1 Candidate Profile Creation

The profile creation will be the first step a candidate will need to take to use the application.

Firstly, the user will need to input different information such as their full name, date of birth, country of residence, postal address, email address, a user name and a password.

The profile creation on the company's side consists of inputting similar information as mentioned earlier: The name of the company, the country where it resides, an email address, a user name and a password.

### 3.3 Anonymization

To prevent discrimination, candidates will be anonymized on the platform. As a result, the personal information provided during account creation will only be accessible to the company and will not be shared or displayed at any time.

The main purpose of this is to avoid the usage of regular recruiting methods such as certifications, instead promoting a different course of selection based on the person on itself.

### 3.4 Matching Process

The matching process in "Adopte 1 Candidat" involves two sides: the candidate and the company. Here's how it works:

#### Candidate Side:

Upon logging into the application, candidates are presented with a list of different companies that may match their skills and preferences. Candidates then review the anonymized profiles of these companies, focusing on the soft skills and job requirements they demand. For each company, candidates have the option to either tick or cross it based on their interest and compatibility. They can explore more about the company and its job offers by clicking on their respective profiles.

#### Company Side:

Recruiters, upon logging in, can view all the candidates who have shown interest in their company by ticking them. They have access to the anonymized profiles of these candidates, showcasing their soft skills and other relevant details. For each candidate, recruiters have the option to either tick or cross them based on their specific needs and job requirements. They can explore more about the candidates by clicking on their profiles.

#### Matching:

A match occurs when both the candidate and the company have ticked each other. Once a match is made, candidates and companies are notified of the successful match via the application. Matched candidates and companies can proceed to communicate further and schedule interviews within the app via email communication.

### 3.5 Application Accessibility

"Adopte 1 Candidat" is currently accessible on Android phones, as we have decided to prioritize mobile accessibility for users. It is however not out of scope to expand accessibility to desktop platforms or to develop versions for iOS devices.

However, at this stage, the focus remains on providing a complete experience for Android users.

## 4. Risks and Assumptions

### 4.1 Risks

| Risk                           | Impact   | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Privacy Concerns          | High     | Data privacy breaches could lead to legal ramifications and damage to the platform's reputation. To mitigate this risk, robust data protection measures will be implemented.                                                     |
| Matching Process Bias          | Moderate | A bias on the matching process could result in unfair or inaccurate matches between candidates and companies. To address this risk, the matching process will undergo testing and validation.                                    |
| Technical Compatibility Issues | Low      | Compatibility issues with different devices, operating systems, or software versions could disrupt the user experience and limit accessibility. To resolve this risk, testing will be pursued on different android environments. |

### 4.2 Budget Consideration

As the application is being created from scratch, there should not be any expenses for the project. However, there may be a need to spend some money to publish the application and to maintain it. We reserve the right to recommend specific functionalities if we feel it is necessary.

### 4.3 Out of Scope

- A screen to view your different matches as a candidate is out of scope.
- A button to pass your profile to a friend so that it can be reviewed by them is out of scope.
- The backend development (such as a database) is not part of the scope.
- An automatization towards the matching process is out of scope.
