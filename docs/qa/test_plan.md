# Test Plan

## Introduction

## Context

The project is a mobile application that allows job seeker to search for jobs via their soft skills rather than job titles.

### Purpose

The goal of the document is to provide a test plan for the project. The document will describe the test strategy, test scope, test objectives, test environment, and test execution plan. The test cases will be described in a [separate document](test_cases.md).

## Test Strategy

Our testing strategy employs a combination of manual and automated testing. The automated testing is left for the software developers to implement. These tests will be used to check that the basic functionalities of the application are working as defined in the functional specifications.
Manual testing is used to check that all the test cases defined are passing. This will go from finding any bugs that may be present to checking that the flow of use of the app is user-friendly.

## Test Environment

The application will be tested on emulators and real devices. The emulators will be used to ensure that the app is working as intended. The real devices will be used to conduct user testing to ensure that the app is user-friendly. The primary target of the app is Android devices.
